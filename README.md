## The Assignment
Title: Code Quiz   
Assignment: 4  
Author: Kyle Kleven    
Course: UofM Coding Boot Camp 

### The Purpose
Build a timed quiz using JavaScript that stores high scores so I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

### How it works
* Click the start button to start the quiz
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
