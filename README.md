## The Repository
This repository ("uofm-bootcamp-homework-04") contains my fourth homework assignment.

## The Assignment
Title: Code Quiz   
Assignment: 4  
Author: Kyle Kleven    
Course: UofM Coding Boot Camp 

### The Purpose
Build a timed quiz using JavaScript that stores high scores so I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

### How it works
* Click the start button to start the quiz
* A timer starts and you am presented with a question
* Answer the question
* See the result beneath the question
* Answer another question
* When you answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* The game is over
* After the game, you can can save my initials and my score, or restart the quiz
